Topic modelling and Sentiment Analysis on Gamestop Tweets

In January 2021, there was a short-position squeeze of US video game retailer GameStop and other stocks on
various stock exchanges, leading to significant financial consequences for certain hedge funds. The short
contraction increased the retailer's share price nearly 190 times from its all-time low of 2.57 dollar to nearly 500
dollar a share, causing large losses for short sellers. About 140 percent of GameStop's shares had been sold
short, and the rush to buy shares to cover those positions as the price rose pushed the price even higher. The
brief squeeze was initially and primarily triggered by users of the WallStreetBets Internet forum on Reddit.
